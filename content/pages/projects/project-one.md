  I have always loved music, from big band jazz to rock. I always wanted to make
  music and it has always been a dream to make a big band jazz song.

I started learning making music some months ago and I have been getting better. I got so good that I have even released my first song on spotify

There is not much to talk about this project as its one of my smaller projects but still a great thing, I would have never thought that I would become so ambitious.
